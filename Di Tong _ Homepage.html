My research investigates various phenomena that affect worker power and/or workplace inequality, including skill change, informal workplace social relations, managerial practices, worker activisms, and the subjective interpretations and experience of inequality at work. I graduated with a M.A. in <a href="https://macss.uchicago.edu/">Computational Social Science</a> from the University of Chicago and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from Tsinghua University.

Here we explore patterns and consequences of changes in occupational skill and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest re-skilling pressure. Recent work found that changing skill requirements are greatest for STEM occupations. Nevertheless, analyzing 167 million online job posts covering 727 occupations over the last decade, we find that re-skilling pressure is greatest for low-skilled occupations when accounting for distance between skills. We further investigate the differences in skill change across employer and market size,  as well as social demographic groups, and find that these differences tend to widen the economic divide. Jobs from large employers and markets experienced less change relative to small employers and markets, and non-white workers in low-skilled jobs are most demographically vulnerable. We conclude by showcasing our model’s potential to precisely chart job evolution towards machine-interface integration using skill embedding spaces.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://github.com/di-Tong/SkillPaper" target="blank">Replication Files</a></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Between-firm Inequality and Informal Social Relations</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href="https://www.nathanwilmers.com/">Nathan Wilmers</a> and <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/programs/phd/victoria-zhang">Victoria Zhang</a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: November 2023</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>Revise and resubmit, American Sociological Review</em></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none">: Employer investment, social closure, peer networks: substantial research highlights sharp differences in informal social structure across workplaces.  Yet, research on pay inequality between firms has largely neglected these differences, in favor of more easily measurable features like firm size or ownership structure. We show how three types of workplace social relations shape firm pay setting: employer relational investment; social closure as a source of bargaining power; and workplace friendships that lock workers into jobs despite low pay.  To operationalize these concepts, we draw on text data from a large archive of job reviews.  Variance decomposition analyses show that differences in social relations account for up to 20% of overall inequality in between-firm pay premiums and 7% of residual inequality.  Differences in informal social organization, and not just formal organization, predict pay differences between firms.</span></p><hr><h2 id="publications">Publication</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07308884231168793" target="blank">An Overview of US Workers’ Current Organizing Efforts and Collective Actions</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Thomas A.

However, union organizing drives in the United States typically meet with strong employer resistance, and such resistance reduces the likelihood that the organizing effort will be successful. In addition to unions, a broad array of other efforts has been initiated to strengthen worker voice and representation. The authors discuss these efforts, including worker centers, and observe that there is no “one size fits all” approach to contemporary worker organizing. </span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-06/Report%20on%20Worker%20Organizing%20Landscape%20in%20US%20by%20Kochan%20Fine%20Bronfenbrenner%20Naidu%20et%20al%20June%202022.pdf" target="blank">Full Report Version</a></p><hr><h2 id="workinprogress">Work in Progress</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">In Search of the High Road: Do Low-Wage Employers Shift Management Practices in Response to Minimum Wage Increases?</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>(MA thesis, MIT Sloan)</em></p><hr><h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2><p>TA for MIT Sloan’s 15.665 Power and Negotiation (2023 Spring)</p>
