My research investigates various phenomena that affect worker power and/or workplace inequality, including skill change, informal workplace social relations, managerial practices, worker activisms, and the subjective interpretations and experience of inequality at work. I graduated with a M.A. in <a href="https://macss.uchicago.edu/">Computational Social Science</a> from the University of Chicago and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from Tsinghua University.

Here we explore the patterns and consequences of changes in occupational skill contents and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest re-skilling pressure. Recent research suggests that high-skilled STEM and technology-intensive occupations have experienced the highest rates of skill content change. Analyzing 727 occupations across 167 million job posts covering the near-universe of the U.S. online labor market between 2010 and 2018, we find that when skill distance is accounted for, re-skilling pressure is much higher for low-skilled occupations, no matter how "low-skill: is defined, either by skill number, pay level, or education degree. We investigate the implications of uneven occupational skill change on workers and find that those from large labor markets and large employers experienced less change, while non-white males in low-skill jobs are the most demographically vulnerable. We conclude by discussing the broad potential of our skill embedding model, which learns skill proximity from skill co-presence across job posts and represents it as distance in the high-dimensional space of complex human capital that corresponds with skilling costs for workers. This model offers a fine-grained measure of the extent to which jobs evolve, and also indicates in what direction job are evolving, as illustrated by the decline in demand for human-interface skills and the rise for those at the machine-interface.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://github.com/di-Tong/SkillPaper" target="blank">Replication Files</a></p><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Between-firm Inequality and Informal Social Relations</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with <a href="https://www.nathanwilmers.com/">Nathan Wilmers</a> and <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/programs/phd/victoria-zhang">Victoria Zhang</a>)</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px">Last Updated: February 2023</p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>Revise and resubmit, American Sociological Review</em></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none">: Some employers consistently offer high pay, and some low pay. These firmwide pay premiums exacerbate labor market inequality. Yet prior research, focused on variation in firms’ formal organization and product market position, has not entirely explained them. We propose that differences in informal social organization across firms accounts for part of this between-firm inequality. Specifically, we show how three types of workplace social relations shape firm premiums: employer relational investment; oppositional worker solidarity as a source of bargaining power; and workplace friendships as a job amenity that allows lower pay. To operationalize these concepts, we draw on text data from a large archive of job reviews. Variance decomposition analyses show that differences in social relations account for up to 15% of overall inequality in between-firm pay premiums and 5% of residual inequality. Differences in informal social organization, and not just formal organization, predict pay differences between firms.</span></p><hr><h2 id="publications">Publication</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07308884231168793" target="blank">An Overview of US Workers’ Current Organizing Efforts and Collective Actions</a></h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px">(with Thomas A.

However, union organizing drives in the United States typically meet with strong employer resistance, and such resistance reduces the likelihood that the organizing effort will be successful. In addition to unions, a broad array of other efforts has been initiated to strengthen worker voice and representation. The authors discuss these efforts, including worker centers, and observe that there is no “one size fits all” approach to contemporary worker organizing. </span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-06/Report%20on%20Worker%20Organizing%20Landscape%20in%20US%20by%20Kochan%20Fine%20Bronfenbrenner%20Naidu%20et%20al%20June%202022.pdf" target="blank">Full Report Version</a></p><hr><h2 id="workinprogress">Work in Progress</h2><h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">In Search of the High Road: Do Low-Wage Employers Shift Management Practices in Response to Minimum Wage Increases?</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>(MA thesis, MIT Sloan)</em></p><hr><h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2><p>TA for MIT Sloan’s 15.665 Power and Negotiation (2023 Spring)</p>
