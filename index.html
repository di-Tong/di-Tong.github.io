<section><h2 id="about">About</h2><p>I am a PhD candidate at MIT Sloan school of management, affiliated with the <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/institute-work-and-employment-research/about-iwer">Institute for Work and Employment Research</a>. I'm on the 2025-2026 academic job market. </p>

<p>My research focuses on the organization of work, with core components including the content of jobs (skill demands, task composition), the division and valuation of work, labor management strategies, worker voice and representation, and informal social relations in workplaces. I document and explain the formation, variation, and change in work organization as shaped by factors such as manager political values, public policies, and platform infrastructures. I also examine the implications of work organization for firm behavior and labor market outcomes, such as pay-setting and wage inequality. </p>

<p>Methodologically, my research primarily uses computational methods and causal inference techniques applied to large-scale sources of digital trace. These sources include job postings, workplace reviews, and LinkedIn worker profiles. I complement these approaches with surveys, qualitative text analyses, and interviews. </p>
 <p>I graduated with a M.A. in <a href="https://macss.uchicago.edu/">Computational Social Science</a> from the University of Chicago and a B.A. in English from Tsinghua University. </p>

 <h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px">Firm Response to Regulatory Costs: Do Minimum Wage Mandates Affect Work Management Practices?</h3><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><em>Revise and Resubmit, Management Science</em></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none">: Firms often respond to costly regulations through evasion, noncompliance, or symbolic compliance. When these strategies are infeasible, do they adjust closely related but unregulated practices to offset regulatory costs? This study examines whether state-mandated minimum wage increases drive firms to modify work management practices as a means to offset regulatory costs, either by reducing nonwage labor expenses or improving worker productivity. I use U.S. employee job reviews to measure management quality across states, firms, and occupations over time in three areas: schedule quality, investment in employees (training, career development, and relational investment), and employee input (autonomy and voice). Drawing on theories of compensating differentials, high-road strategy, and organizational inertia, I test competing hypotheses using difference-indifferences analyses. The results show that as firms comply with wage mandates, they, on average, neither compromise job quality in non-wage aspects nor thoroughly upgrade management systems in the high-road direction. These findings underscore organizational inertia despite economic pressure to offset regulatory costs, revealing a decoupled relationship between wage-setting and non-wage work management design. </span></p>

Here we explore patterns of occupational skill change and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest reskilling requirements. Recent work found that changing skill requirements are greatest for STEM occupations in the 2010s. Nevertheless, analyzing 167 million online job posts covering 727 occupations, we find that skill change is greatest for low-skilled occupations when accounting for distance between skills. We further investigate the differences in skill change across employer and market size, as well as social demographic groups. We find that jobs from small employers and markets experienced larger skill upgrades to catch up with the skill demands of their large employers and markets. Female and minority workers are disproportionately employed in low-skilled jobs and face the most significant skill adjustments. While these varied skill changes could create uneven reskilling pressures across workers, they may also lead to a narrowing of gaps in job quality and prospects. We conclude by showcasing our model's potential to chart job evolution directions using skill embedding spaces.</span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://github.com/di-Tong/SkillPaper" target="blank">Replication Files</a></p>

Yet studies of pay inequality between firms have largely neglected these differences in favor of more easily measurable features like firm size or ownership structure. We show how three types of workplace social relations shape firm pay setting: employer relational investment that supports higher wages, social closure as a source of bargaining power, and amenity ties that lock workers into jobs despite low pay. To operationalize these concepts, we draw on text data from a large archive of job reviews. Variance decomposition analyses show that differences in social relations account for up to 20% of overall inequality in between-firm pay premiums and 7% of residual inequality. Differences in informal social organization, and not just formal organization, predict pay differences between firms.</span></p>

However, union organizing drives in the United States typically meet with strong employer resistance, and such resistance reduces the likelihood that the organizing effort will be successful. In addition to unions, a broad array of other efforts has been initiated to strengthen worker voice and representation. The authors discuss these efforts, including worker centers, and observe that there is no “one size fits all” approach to contemporary worker organizing. </span></p><p style="margin:0 0 5px"><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-06/Report%20on%20Worker%20Organizing%20Landscape%20in%20US%20by%20Kochan%20Fine%20Bronfenbrenner%20Naidu%20et%20al%20June%202022.pdf" target="blank">Full Report Version</a></p>
